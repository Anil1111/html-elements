# How various CSS frameworks style bare HTML elements

This repo contains an HTML page with all HTML5 elements for styling. I added a style switcher ([like it's 2001](https://alistapart.com/article/alternate)) to dynamically switch between the style sheets of various CSS frameworks and studying how they deal with HTML elements.

## HTML source

- [WHATWG](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/dev/semantics.html)
- [W3C](http://w3c.github.io/html/semantics.html)
- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTML/Element)

## Inspiration

- [*HTML page with (most) all elements, for styling*](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4790046/html-page-with-most-all-elements-for-styling)
- [HTML Elements Index](https://meiert.com/en/indices/html-elements/)
- [Native form elements](http://nativeformelements.com)
